                        p.answer.collapse(id="answer3") We look at the monthly data on energy consumption from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). This data says how much natural gas, coal, solar power, etc. was consumed by people and industries around you in the past thirty days. We translate it into greenhouse gas emission levels, and compare these with the plans set by federal and local governments.
